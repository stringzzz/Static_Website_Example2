# Static_Website_Example2
About 3 and 1/2 weeks into learning web development. Got a bit better, but tried to keep it simple too.

Once again, the point was to take something I don't know too much about and use it as an example to build a website, as if asked by a customer to do so.
I don't know much about restaurants or bakeries, aside from eating at them, so this was a good exercise for improving my design skills. 
On top of using code I learned over the last couple of weeks, I also applied the 60/30/10 rule for the first time in this project.

I feel it may look better with some more details, but then again that might make it too complicated and "noisy" looking. Either way, this was a 
fun project for me, and I look forward to being able to do even more.
